The mission of the NEMO Lab is to connect undergraduate students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with oportunites to get involved in mathematics research and outreach projects outside of the typical classroom setting.

Spring 2024
---------------
Project on quantum computation mentored by [Dr. Tefjol Pllaha](https://www.math.unl.edu/~tpllaha2/) with student participants Donovan Dyk, Helena Holland, Jack Murphy, Nick Starns, Ian Sutton. This project is supported by the UNL Grand Challenges catalyst award entitled Quantum Approaches addressing Global Threats.

Fall 2024
---------------
Project on quantum machine learning mentored by [Dr. Levi Heath](https://leviheath.weebly.com/). This topic is accessible to students who have taken or are taking Math 314/315.  This project is supported by the UNL Grand Challenges catalyst award entitled Quantum Approaches addressing Global Threats. 

* Title: An Exploration of Quantum Data (Towards Quantum Machine Learning)
* Goal of the Project: Understand quantum data and approaches to converting classical data (like a matrix) to quantum data.
* Description: Quantum computing can speed up computations. However, when it comes to processes requiring large amounts of (classically stored) data, like a matrix or array of numbers, we are limited by our approaches for converting classical data to quantum data. We will study a strategy for converting classical data to quantum data using tools from linear algebra (Math 314 at UNL).
Developing machine learning models and artificial intelligence are examples of data-intensive computational processes, which are a motivation for this project. Time permitting, we will build intuition for and train a quantum machine learning model.
* Applications are open for interested undergraduate students! Apply using [this form](https://forms.gle/w2JRxjQSY4v4zqyj8) by August 16, 2024.

Spring 2025
-----------------
Project on period doubling and chaos in a system of differential equations mentored by [Prof. Glenn Ledder](https://math.unl.edu/glenn-ledder). This topic is accessible to students who have taken Math 221. Applications will open in winter 2024.
