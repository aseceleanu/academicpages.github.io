Spring 2024 - Quantum Computing
-----------------------------------------------
Project on quantum computation mentored by [Dr. Tefjol Pllaha](https://www.math.unl.edu/~tpllaha2/) with student participants Donovan Dyk, Helena Holland, Jack Murphy, Nick Starns, Ian Sutton. This project is supported by the UNL Grand Challenges catalyst award entitled Quantum Approaches addressing Global Threats.
