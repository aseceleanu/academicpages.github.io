I am an associate professor of mathematics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. My research focuses on commutative algebra with a geometric and computational flavor.

I have been awarded the 2018 [Harold & Esther Edgerton Junior Faculty Award](https://executivevc.unl.edu/faculty/evaluation-recognition/awards/edgerton) for creative research, extraordinary teaching abilities, and academic promise.

I co-organize the workshops[ Women in Commutative Algebra II](https://mathstat.dal.ca/~faridi/WICAII) at CIRM Trento on October 16-20, 2023 and [Women in Commutative Algebra III](https://mathstat.dal.ca/~faridi/WICAIII) at CMO Oaxaca June 2-7, 2024.

In the news: [When life gives you lemons, make mathematicians](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202103/rnoti-p375.pdf), an article in the Notices of the AMS about the Polymath program - a large scale online REU I mentor.

Undergraduate Activities
======

I have mentored a team of students working in the [Polymath Jr.](https://geometrynyc.wixsite.com/polymathreu) large-scale undergraduate research programs of 2020, 2021, and 2023. This wonderful group of students produced four [papers](\https://aseceleanu.github.io/papers) papers listed.

In co-organize the [Central States Mathematics Undergraduate Research Conference](https://math.unl.edu/events/cesmur) in partnership with colleagues at Kansas State University.

I am the founder and director of the [Nebraska Experiential Mathematics and Outreach (NEMO) Lab](https://aseceleanu.github.io/NEMO) affiliated with the [Geometry Labs United](https://geometrylabs.net)  network.
