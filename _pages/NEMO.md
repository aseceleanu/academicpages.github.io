The mission of the NEMO Lab is to connect undergraduate students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with opportunites to get involved in mathematics research and outreach projects outside of the typical classroom setting.

Spring 2024 - Quantum Computing
-----------------------------------------------
Project on quantum computation mentored by [Dr. Tefjol Pllaha](https://www.math.unl.edu/~tpllaha2/) with student participants Donovan Dyk, Helena Holland, Jack Murphy, Nick Starns, Ian Sutton. This project is supported by the UNL Grand Challenges catalyst award entitled Quantum Approaches addressing Global Threats.

Watch Helena Holland defend her honors thesis [Quantum Computing and U.S. Cybersecurity](https://unl.zoom.us/rec/share/6X5hyIFNO3kOFUP2NReX9kj2y3jvtMa07HEy-zDjtPnVkgXP8Hjs6nBGxm12x74U.7rCtVy1v0yQsKl3y startTime=1709233375000), which earned highest distinction.

Fall 2024 - Quantum Machine Learning
----------------------------------------------------
Project on quantum machine learning mentored by [Dr. Levi Heath](https://leviheath.weebly.com/) with student participants Ben Gerdes, Caleb Holmbeck, Andrew Maas, Ally Muellner, Reva Long, Hannah Pearce, Bishop Placke, and Thy Tran.
