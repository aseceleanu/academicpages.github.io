I am an associate professor of mathematics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. My research focuses on commutative algebra with a geometric and computational flavor.

I have been awarded the 2018 [Harold & Esther Edgerton Junior Faculty Award](https://executivevc.unl.edu/faculty/evaluation-recognition/awards/edgerton) for creative research, extraordinary teaching abilities, and academic promise.

I co-organize the workshops[ Women in Commutative Algebra II](https://mathstat.dal.ca/~faridi/WICAII) at CIRM Trento on October 16-20, 2023 and [Women in Commutative Algebra III](https://mathstat.dal.ca/~faridi/WICAIII) at CMO Oaxaca June 2-7, 2024.

In the news: [When life gives you lemons, make mathematicians](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202103/rnoti-p375.pdf), an article in the Notices of the AMS about the Polymath program - a large scale online REU I mentor.

Undergraduate Activities
======

I have mentored a team of students working in the [Polymath Jr.](https://geometrynyc.wixsite.com/polymathreu) programs of 2020, 2021, and 2023. This wonderful group of students produced four of the papers listed below.

In co-organize the [Central States Mathematics Undergraduate Research Conference](https://math.unl.edu/events/cesmur) in partnership with colleagues at Kansas State University.

I am the founder and director of the [Nebraska Experiential Mathematics and Outreach (NEMO) Lab](https://aseceleanu.github.io/NEMO) affiliated with the [Geometry Labs United](https://geometrylabs.net)  network.

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
