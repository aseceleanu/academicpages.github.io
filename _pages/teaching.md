Below are notes from graduate topics courses and other lecture series I have taught. While I have made a good-faith effort to keep these notes free of typos, there may still be some typos I have not caught. 

* [Computational Algebra](https:aseceleanu.github.io/files/Computational_alg_notes) notes for Math 918 in Fall 2013 typeset by Peder Thompson.

* [Lefschetz Properties](https:aseceleanu.github.io/files/918-Lefschetz-Notes) notes for Math 918 in Fall 2019.

*[Symbolic powers](https:aseceleanu.github.io/files/SNALectures) notes for the graduate school Scoala Nationala de Algebra in Bucharest, 2023.

*[Lefschetz Properties from a Topological Perspective](https:aseceleanu.github.io/files/Lefschetz Preparatory School) notes for the graduate school on Lefschetz Properties in Algebra, Geometry and Combinatorics in Krakow, 2024.
